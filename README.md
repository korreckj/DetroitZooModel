Detroit Zoo Model

This repo contains the python files I use to create a pytorch vision model, and the utilities to save it as a mlpackage for use in iOS and macOS.

The dataset is not included due to its size, it uses a variety of robot.txt respecting scrapes and original photography.  If I'm able to remove all scraped images from it eventually I will find a place to put it online.
